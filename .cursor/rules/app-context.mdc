Need 1 is a campus‑exclusive gig‑exchange platform that lets verified *.edu* students post everyday micro‑jobs—moving boxes across dorms, last‑minute calculus tutoring, designing club flyers—and match instantly with classmates who can fulfill them.  
Differentiators:

1. **Verified Trust** – sign‑up requires university credentials; “.edu Verified” badge shown on every profile.  
2. **Safe‑Spot Meet‑ups** – built‑in campus‑police exchange‑zone map.  
3. **Privacy‑First Chat** – number‑masked and auto‑deletes after seven days.  
4. **Reputation & Impact** – Micro‑Karma points plus Eco‑Impact badge for each completed job.  
5. **Engagement Hooks** – Flash‑Market drops, class‑specific channels, and earn‑and‑burn campus credits keep the feed lively—without handling payments.

Need 1 positions itself as **“the fastest, safest, and most sustainable way for students to get things done.”**
